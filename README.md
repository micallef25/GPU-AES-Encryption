### Analysis

Unfortunately, I will be taking a zero for this part of the project. I implemented some stuff on the GPU and CPU but not hardly enough to warrant any respect.

Thursday morning I flew to Michigan to be in a wedding and came back Monday morning. Needless to say I underestimated time.

Instead of grading my project please enjoy these nice photos of me from the wedding and a yak I found near my house in MI.
